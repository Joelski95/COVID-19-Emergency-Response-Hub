# COVID-19 Emergency Response Hub

The Community Response Hub was designed after realising that Parish Councils do not have a case mangement/ticket submission system.

The application supports requests for food, medicine and emotional support.

# Dependencies 

Flask, Flask-WTF, flask-sqlalchemy, flask-user, twilio, web pages call out to a CDN for Bootstrap.

# Installation

See the installation guide on the [Wiki](https://github.com/kittymagician/COVID-19-Emergency-Response-Hub/wiki/Installation)
